# What do we need to share if we want to get a quick overview of a supervised machine learning approach?

__Choose between scenario 1 or 2 and work with a partner__

_Duration: 12 minutes_

## Scenario 1
_Duration: 7 minutes_

You could not attend to the Galaxy tutorial about supervised machine learning at the ELIXIR All hands 2022. If you want to quickly get a grasp about the supervised machine learning approach discussed in that tutorial, what would you ask to a colleague who did attend?

Task (tell, 5 minutes): work in pairs and prettend one of you is getting information about this Galaxy tutorial. What key information do you want to know about? Write down each piece of information on a sticky note.
Task (show, 2 minutes): Go to the Scenario 1 board and add your sticky notes, if you see a similar note from another group, stick your note close to that one.

## Scenario 2
_Duration: 7 minutes_

You attended to the Galaxy tutorial about supervised machine learning at the ELIXIR All hands 2022. Thanks to this tutorial, you have succesfully implemented a machine learning approach to recognize images containing handwritten digits. You have a colleague who did not attend but have also worked on this task. What information do you need to compare the two approaches?

Task (tell, 5 minutes): Work in pairs (suggestion: change partners) and work on a list of those elementst from you machine learning approaches that could be compared. 
Task (show, 2 minutes): Go to the Scenario 2 board and add your sticky notes, if you see a similar note from another group, stick your note close to that one.

## Quick summary of the activity 
_Duration: 5 minutes_

After a quick look/read of what people have added to the boards, do you think any of these pieces of information will make it easier for you to reproduce a supervised machine learning approach? Which ones? Say it aloud.
